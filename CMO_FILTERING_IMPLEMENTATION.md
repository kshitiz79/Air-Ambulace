# CMO Data Filtering Implementation Summary

## ✅ **Backend Changes Completed**

### 1. **Updated Enquiry Controller** (`Backand/src/controller/enquiryController.js`)
- ✅ Added JWT token extraction middleware (`extractUserFromToken`)
- ✅ Modified `getAllEnquiries()` to filter by `submitted_by_user_id` for CMO users
- ✅ Modified `getEnquiryById()` to only allow CMO access to their own enquiries
- ✅ Modified `searchEnquiries()` to filter search results by CMO user
- ✅ Added `getCMODashboardStats()` function for CMO-specific statistics

### 2. **Updated Routes** (`Backand/src/routes/enquiryRoute.js`)
- ✅ Added authentication middleware to all routes
- ✅ Added new route `/cmo/dashboard-stats` for CMO statistics

### 3. **Security Features**
- ✅ User ID extracted from JWT token (not from request parameters)
- ✅ Role-based filtering (only CMO users get filtered data)
- ✅ Proper error messages for unauthorized access
- ✅ All database queries automatically filter by user for CMO role

## ✅ **Frontend Changes Completed**

### 1. **Updated CMO Dashboard** (`Web-Air-Ambulace/src/pages/CMO/Dashboard.jsx`)
- ✅ Added user role detection
- ✅ Added visual indicator showing "Showing only your enquiries" for CMO users
- ✅ Enhanced logging to show filtering status
- ✅ All API calls now automatically filtered by backend

## 🎯 **How It Works Now**

### **For CMO Users:**
1. **Login** → JWT token contains user ID and role
2. **Dashboard Access** → Backend automatically filters all data by `submitted_by_user_id`
3. **API Calls** → All enquiry endpoints filter by current CMO's user ID
4. **Visual Feedback** → Dashboard shows "Showing only your enquiries" indicator

### **For Other Users (Admin, SDM, DM):**
1. **No Filtering** → They see all enquiries as before
2. **Full Access** → No restrictions on data access

## 🔒 **Security Implementation**

### **Data Isolation:**
- ✅ Each CMO can only see enquiries they created (`submitted_by_user_id = current_user_id`)
- ✅ Search results are filtered by user
- ✅ Individual enquiry access is restricted
- ✅ Dashboard statistics only show user's own data

### **Access Control:**
- ✅ JWT token validation on every request
- ✅ User ID extracted from verified token
- ✅ Role-based filtering logic
- ✅ Proper error handling for unauthorized access

## 🚀 **API Endpoints**

### **Existing Endpoints (Now Filtered for CMO):**
- `GET /api/enquiries` - Returns only CMO's enquiries
- `GET /api/enquiries/:id` - Only accessible if CMO created it
- `GET /api/enquiries/search` - Search only within CMO's enquiries

### **New Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/enquiries/cmo/dashboard-stats` - CMO-specific statistics

## 📊 **What CMO Users See Now**

### **Dashboard:**
- ✅ Only enquiries they created
- ✅ Statistics based on their enquiries only
- ✅ Charts and graphs filtered by their data
- ✅ Visual indicator showing data is filtered

### **All Pages:**
- ✅ Enquiry lists show only their enquiries
- ✅ Search results filtered by their data
- ✅ Detail pages only accessible for their enquiries
- ✅ All statistics and counts are user-specific

## 🧪 **Testing**

### **To Test:**
1. **Create 2 CMO users** in your database
2. **Login as CMO User 1** and create some enquiries
3. **Login as CMO User 2** and create different enquiries
4. **Verify** that each CMO only sees their own enquiries
5. **Test all pages** - Dashboard, lists, search, details

### **Expected Results:**
- ✅ CMO User 1 sees only their enquiries
- ✅ CMO User 2 sees only their enquiries
- ✅ No cross-user data access
- ✅ Admin/other roles see all enquiries

## 🎉 **Benefits**

### **Data Privacy:**
- ✅ Complete data isolation between CMO users
- ✅ No accidental access to other users' data
- ✅ Secure multi-tenant architecture

### **User Experience:**
- ✅ Clean, focused dashboard showing only relevant data
- ✅ Faster loading (less data to process)
- ✅ Clear visual feedback about filtering

### **Security:**
- ✅ Token-based authentication
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Server-side filtering (not client-side)

## 🔧 **Next Steps**

1. **Test the implementation** with multiple CMO users
2. **Verify all pages** work correctly with filtering
3. **Check performance** with the new filtering
4. **Add any additional CMO-specific features** if needed

## 📝 **Important Notes**

- ✅ **Backward Compatible** - Other user roles (Admin, SDM, DM) are not affected
- ✅ **Automatic Filtering** - No frontend changes needed for filtering logic
- ✅ **Secure** - All filtering happens on the server side
- ✅ **Scalable** - Can easily extend to other roles if needed

Your CMO users now have complete data privacy and will only see the enquiries they created on every page of the dashboard! 🎯
